# Thermostat exercise

In this exercise we will apply the course materials from software engineering. The project will start simple and will continue to grow with features and refactorings. It is important to keep up with the extensions as they build further on the exercises that where previously made.

## Updating exercise instructions

## Tagging releases

The exercise will continue to grow with extra features and changes. It is important to track the different states (or versions) of this project. For this we can make use of git **tags**.

At the end of every exercise you will need to _tag_ your version or commit. You can do this with the git tag command:

```
git tag v0.1
```

If for some reason you forgot to tag your version, and want to add an tag to a previous commit, you can simply add the commit hash at the end of the git tag command to tag that commit.

You can lookup previous commit by using git log:

```
git log --pretty=oneline
15027957951b64cf874c3557a0f3547bd83b3ff6 Merge branch 'experiment'

```

and then tag th

```
git tag v0.2 9fceb02
```

All made tags can be listed using the git tag command.

```
git tag
```

Tags are created locally by default. When pushing commits to a remote you need to specifically tell git to push the tags. You can do this with the following command:

```
git push origin --tags
```

Always check on GitHub in your project that the tags are pushed correctly.

## Versions

### v0.1 Thermostat

The goal of this version is to create software solution that acts as a thermostat. Given that we have some temperatures, we would like to know what the result is. The result can be used to control a heating and airconditioning unit.

A thermostat can be set to a _wanted temperature_ value for a room. To prevent oscillations and improve efficiency we need to give a dead-zone or _range_ where the thermostat will neither put on the heating nor put on the airco. Next we need to be able to give the thermostat the _current temperature_ so that it can calculate the result.

![Thermostat](./img/Thermostat.png)

Create a small Ruby application that demonstrates the functionality of an `Thermostat` class. The application could have the following class structure.

![Thermostat app](./img/simple-thermostat-app.png)

The application (for now) can define some hard-coded temperatures. For each of those temperatures, we will pass them to the `Thermostat` and display the results in the console.

The goal of the `App` is just to verify the `Thermostat` class, and that it is able to correctly control heating and airco units.
