# Thermostat exercise

In this exercise we will apply the course materials from software engineering. The project will start simple and will continue to grow with features and refactorings. It is important to keep up with the extensions as they build further on the exercises that where previously made.

## Updating exercise instructions

Exercise instructions will be added as weeks pass. To get the latest instructions you need to pull them into your own project. This can be done with the following command:

```
git pull https://github.com/vives-softwareengineering-2019/thermostat.git master --allow-unrelated-histories
```

This will add or update the `exercise.md` file and its dependencies in your own project.

## Tagging releases

The exercise will continue to grow with extra features and changes. It is important to track the different states (or versions) of this project. For this we can make use of git **tags**.

At the end of every exercise you will need to _tag_ your version or commit. You can do this with the git tag command:

```
git tag v0.1
```

If for some reason you forgot to tag your version, and want to add an tag to a previous commit, you can simply add the commit hash at the end of the git tag command to tag that commit.

You can lookup previous commit by using git log:

```
git log --pretty=oneline
15027957951b64cf874c3557a0f3547bd83b3ff6 Merge branch 'experiment'

8a5cbc430f1a9c3d00faaeffd07798508422908a updated readme
```

and then add the commit hash when creating the tag 

```
git tag v0.2 9fceb02
```

All made tags can be listed using the git tag command.

```
git tag
```

Tags are created locally by default. When pushing commits to a remote you need to specifically tell git to push the tags. You can do this with the following command:

```
git push origin --tags
```

Always check on GitHub in your project that the tags are pushed correctly.

## Versions

### v0.1 Thermostat

The goal of this version is to create software solution that acts as a thermostat. Given that we have some temperatures, we would like to know what the result is. The result can be used to control a heating and cooling unit.

A thermostat can be set to a _wanted temperature_ value for a room. To prevent oscillations and improve efficiency we need to give a dead-zone or _range_ where the thermostat will neither put on the heating nor put on the cooling. Next we need to be able to give the thermostat the _current temperature_ so that it can calculate the result.

![Thermostat](./img/Thermostat.png)

Create a small Ruby application that demonstrates the functionality of an `Thermostat` class. The application could have the following class structure.

![Thermostat app](./img/simple-thermostat-app.png)

The application (for now) can define some hard-coded temperatures. For each of those temperatures, we will pass them to the `Thermostat` and display the results in the console.

The goal of the `App` is just to verify the `Thermostat` class, and that it is able to correctly control heating and cooling units.

#### Tips

##### Directory structure

It's always a good idea to structure your files. All your classes should live inside a `lib` directory. The `app.rb` file can be placed inisde the root directory. This structure will result in a clean project, it will allow you to easely find your files, and give feedback about theire function.

```
thermostat-yourname
│   app.rb
└───lib
        class_a.rb
        class_b.rb
        class_c.rb
```

##### Eliminating `require_relative`

If you structure your files like the example abouve you  will be able to replace all `require_relative` functions by simple `require` functions. This will make your code way more portable and will handle refactorings much easier.

When running your application, the `require` statements must be able to find your files. You just have to tell the Ruby runtime that your `lib` directory should be included. This can be done by using the `-I` flag followed by the name of the directory. In this case that should become `-Ilib`

```shell
ruby -Ilib app.rb
```

##### Floats vs Integer

When testing your application, keep in mind that it should work with floating point numbers. Because of Ruby's *strong typing* you MUST supply floating point notations while testing. For example if you would like to test with the value of `20` (Integer), then you need to explicitly write `20.0` (Float). Ruby will not automaticaly cast the Integer into a Float or visa versa.

### v0.2 JSON Thermostat

The `Thermostat` application is cool, but in only works using the commandline. The `Thermostat` should also be able to work using JSON. Many applications provide information in JSON format. Making sure our thermostat is able to receive and resond with JSON will make it usable in many more situations. 

In this version, you will create a `JSONThermostat` Class that is able to receive the settings in a JSON String, and is able to repond with a JSON String containing the result.

The `JSONThermostat` class can accept the **settings** in JSON format. The expected format is:

```json
{
  "temperature": 20.0,
  "range": 1.0
}
```

Once the `JSONThermostat` is set, it can process new values using an `update` method. The `update` method will again accept JSON using the following format:

```json
{
  "temperature": 23.4
}
```

The return value of the `update` method will output a JSON formatted `String`. An example is show below.

```json
{
  "cooling": false,
  "heating": false
}
```

#### Tests

Instead of using an `app.rb` or other application to test the behaviour of the `JSONThermostat` we can me use of *Software Tests*. In the `test` directory you can find some tests that will create an instance of your `JSONThermostat` class and will run some code against it. When everything works as expected, the tests will PASS. If your implementation is not correct, the tests will FAIL. These test will give feedback on the expected behaviour of your code.

To run the tests, you can execute the following command:

```shell
rake test
```

If all goes well and everything works like expected, you will get the following result:

```shell
Run options: --seed 48182

# Running:

..........

Finished in 0.004125s, 2424.1837 runs/s, 3636.2755 assertions/s.

10 runs, 15 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips
```

If a test fails, you will get feedback why the test failed. For example:

```shell
Run options: --seed 64935

# Running:

F.........

Finished in 0.120293s, 83.1306 runs/s, 124.6958 assertions/s.
